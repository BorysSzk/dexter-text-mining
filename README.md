# "Dexter" text mining analysis

## What is "Dexter" text mining analysis?
"Dexter" Text Mining Analysis is an R-based application that explores and analyzes the scripts of Season 1 (for more info, see the `Disclaimer` below) using a wide range of text mining packages 
- from basic ones like tm and tidytext, to more advanced tools like topicmodels and skmeans.
The project also features a local Shiny web app that showcases all the visualizations from the analysis, along with explanations and interpretations of key findings.

Learn the basics of text mining through:
- Word clouds and word frequency analysis  
- Sentiment analysis  
- Topic modeling (LDA)  
- Document segmentation using clustering methods (e.g., k-means, spherical k-means)  
- And other natural language processing techniques in R.

And one more thing: *tonight's the night*...

## Build Prerequisites
"Dexter" text mining analysis's build environment requires a couple of R packages in order to work, but before that make sure that you have downloaded and using:
- **R 3.6.0+** from [CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/) (located at the top, in the `Download and install R` tab);
- **RStudio Desktop** from [Posit](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) (in the middle of the website you can find downloads for Windows, macOS, Ubuntu etc.);
- **Java Development Kit (JDK â‰¥ 8)** - required for `qdap` R package
> [!NOTE]
> Installing the JDK is not required to run the Shiny web app. If you're only interested in viewing the app's content, this step is optional.

## Installation
Clone the repository to your computer with:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/BorysSzk/dexter-text-mining.git
```
If you don't have Git installed, you can download the repository as a ZIP file from the repository page.

After cloning/downloading the repository, set your working directory in R to the project folder (`dexter-text-mining-main` folder) in R studio console, for example:
```sh
setwd(C:/Users/user1/Desktop/dexter-text-mining-main)
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **If you are only interested in running the Shiny web app (showcase of the analysis)** go to `Running "Dexter" text mining analysis` part down below

**If you are interested in the whole project, including R code of the text mining**:
Run the following command to install the packages:
```sh
source("install-packages.R")
```

## Running "Dexter" text mining analysis
1. Make sure your working directory is the project directory.
2. Load the project workspace, in the RStudio console with:
```sh
load('project.RData')
```
3. Next, start the web app, in the RStudio console run:
```sh
shiny::runApp()
```
The app will launch at [http://127.0.0.1:7216](http://127.0.0.1:7216).
> [!TIP]
> The app will open in the RStudio browser - at the top of the browser there is a button `Open in browser` which will open the web app in the default browser of your system
