“Popping Cherry”

FADE IN:

1   ON DEXTER                                                       1

His face kind of scrunched into a look of compassion.   Start
slowly PULLING BACK --

DEXTER (V.O.)
You’d never know I was a sociopath.
I’m quite well versed in human
behavior, and when I apply myself,
nobody can tell I’m faking it --
except at funerals.

We can now see that Dexter stands among a group of MOURNERS,
half of them in tears or weeping.

DEXTER (V.O.)
I’m not good at grief. In those
cases, shades come in handy.

Dexter dons a pair of DARK SHADES.   REVEAL that we’re --

EXT. BEACH - DAY 1

By the turquoise water’s edge, six Miami Police HONOR GUARD
stand at attention on either side of a lectern, surrounded
by flower arrangements. Sixty folding chairs are filled,
many of them by uniformed MEN and WOMEN in law enforcement.
Dexter stands among a group of mourners behind the chairs.

At the lectern, Detective STEVE McNAMARA, 40s, brave and
dignified but torn up inside, talks into a microphone.

DET. MCNAMARA
Miami’s full of good cops. A lot of
‘em here today. But no offense, I
wouldn’t want any of you hitting on my
sister.
(then)
Ricky was different.

WEAVE AMONG the mourners to find DEBRA paying respects, a
stoic BATISTA listening, LT. LAGUERTA eyeing the reporters
and cameras, and SGT. DOAKES fighting back real emotion.

DET. MCNAMARA
He was a guy you wanted your sister to
fall for, ‘cause you just knew he’d
respect her, marry her -- and he did.

DET. MCNAMARA (CONT'D)
I never saw Kara as happy as she was
with Ricky.

CUT TO:

2   AFTER THE SERVICE                                                2

Knee-deep in water, TWO ELDERLY COUPLES, the parents of the
deceased, spread their children’s ashes in the ocean. By
the shore, bereaved officers, friends, and family members
congregate and commiserate as they watch. Doakes approaches
McNamara, who stands with two rough-and-tumble COP FRIENDS.

SGT. DOAKES
It’s a fucking travesty.

DET. MCNAMARA
(appreciates the support)
Thanks, man.

COP FRIEND
Heard you’re going after Guerrero.

SGT. DOAKES
Shit yeah. This ain’t over. Guerrero
ordered these hits. I’m gonna make
something stick to that cartel cock-
sucker.

DET. MCNAMARA
I never knew you and Ricky were so
tight.

Doakes, who was actually sleeping with Ricky’s wife, covers.

SGT. DOAKES
Ain’t about that. Fuck with a cop,
lose the privilege to walk the streets
we protect, am I right?

As the cop friends enthusiastically ad lib their agreement,
SWING AROUND to find Lt. LaGuerta a short distance away,
giving sound bites to a TV NEWS CREW.

LAGUERTA
We’re heartbroken over the tragic loss
of our fallen brother. But we praise
his courage. Ricky Simmons knew no
fear. I always called him the
gutsiest man on the police force.

Debra WIPES PAST, staring in disgust.    FOLLOW her to Dexter.

2   CONTINUED:                                                   2

DEBRA
Can you believe that cow?   She didn’t
even know Simmons.

DEXTER
At least she knew he was a cop...
unless, wait -- did you tell her?

Debra smiles.

DEBRA
I’m proud of you for coming, Bro.   I
know you hate funerals. How you
holding up?

DEXTER
(brave breath)
I’m managing.

Debra gives his arm a sympathy squeeze then splits off.
Dexter turns to look out to sea, where the two elderly
couples are returning from spreading ashes.

DEXTER (V.O.)
No I’m not. Keeping one’s face
pinched in sorrow for two hours
straight is a real chore.

Dexter’s attention drifts to a CHILD using a red plastic
shovel to build castles in the sand.

DEXTER (V.O.)
Ooh, that reminds me. I need to pick
up a shovel for my next project.

3   EXT. CORRECTIONS FACILITY - DAY 1                                 3
A batch of hardcore YOUNG MEN -- all races, sizes, and gang
affiliations, but none older than 21 -- are escorted by a
PRISON GUARD out the front gates of a low-slung, concrete
facility surrounded by high chain-link. Excited families,
gangsters, and hoodrats greet them.

DEXTER (V.O.)
Florida prisons kick free 25,000
inmates a year. They don’t do that
for me, but it sure feels like it.

4   INT. DEXTER’S CAR - DAY 1                                         4

CLOSE ON a gleaming RED SHOVEL, price tag and stickers still
attached, propped up in the passenger seat. PAN to Dexter,
parked out front, watching the young men being released.

DEXTER (V.O.)
I search for ones who think they beat
the system. They’re not hard to find.
Like young Jeremy Downs.

Dexter sees JEREMY, 19, hardened beyond his years. He steps
through the gate, squinting into the sunlight. The guard
escorts Jeremy, who has no one to greet him, into a van that
says “Homestead Halfway House.”

DEXTER (V.O.)
Today, Jeremy is just another piece of
trash on the street. But four years
ago, he was the toast of Miami...

CUT TO:

5   A SCREEN                                                         5

An Asian REPORTER stands in a park, holding a microphone. A
GRAPHIC reads: “BREAKING NEWS. SANDRA YEE. MIAMI.” Police
cars can be seen behind her, along with yellow police tape
stretched out to keep a gathering CROWD out of the park.

SANDRA YEE
It was a gruesome scene today. The
bloody body of a teenage boy found
stabbed to death inside this South
Miami park.

PULL BACK to reveal that we are --

INT. DEXTER’S APARTMENT - NIGHT 1

Dexter sits shirtless behind his desk on a hot Miami night,
eating popcorn and watching the archived NEWS REPORT on his
computer. A gentle breeze billows the curtains behind him.

SANDRA YEE
Police haven’t released the name of
the victim, but our sources tell us
that investigators are holding a 15-
year-old suspect in custody.

On the computer, B-ROLL NEWS FOOTAGE shows uniform officers
wheeling out a BODY covered by a white sheet, followed by
fuzzy LONG-LENS SHOTS of police poking around the area.

SANDRA YEE
We’re hearing that the suspect lured
the older boy to the pond to spot
alligators. But once they were alone,
the victim was robbed and repeatedly
stabbed.

5   CONTINUED:                                                  5

Using the mouse, Dexter closes the window on-screen with the
news report and clicks on a folder with AUTOPSY PHOTOS. He
starts flipping through COLOR STILLS of the dirty, bloody
body of a HEAVYSET BOY, 17, crisscrossed with deep knife
wounds.

DEXTER (V.O.)
To the coroner, the knife strokes
looked random, impulsive. But I saw
the work of a young virtuoso. Too
many major arteries were severed...
femoral, brachial, carotid.

Dexter, staring with wide eyes, takes a bite of popcorn.   He
clicks the mouse and a PHOTO OF JEREMY in the courtroom
appears. The boy has a smug smile on his face.

DEXTER (V.O.)
Jeremy got off easy. Four years in a
juvenile facility for manslaughter.
But I knew what he was, and what he’d
do again. All I had to do was circle
my calendar... and wait.

PUSH INTO the bulletin board near the desk, where on the
calendar a DATE IS CIRCLED that says: “Jeremy.”

SMASH CUT TO:

6   EXT. RITA’S HOUSE - YARD - DAY 2                                6

From a LOW ANGLE in the dirt, the new RED SHOVEL swiftly
STRIKES down on us. Dexter, wearing jeans and a t-shirt,
wields the shovel. He uses the sharp edge to hack at
something we can’t see. We can only imagine what, until --
THE LUMINOUS RITA

Strolls up in a skirt with a tray of ice-cold lemonade.

RITA
Lemonade for my sweaty workers?

REVEAL that Dexter is digging up a dead little LEMON TREE in
front of her modest home. Nearby, CODY and ASTOR play in
the dirt with hand shovels. Dexter turns to the kids.

DEXTER
What do you say, crew?   Anyone
parched?

CODY
What’s parched?

6   CONTINUED:                                                   6

They come over for drinks.   Astor carries her little doll
inside a plastic zip-lock.

RITA
Once we put in the new lemon tree,
we’ll make our own fresh-squeezed
lemonade.

ASTOR
(excited)
Can we have a lemonade stand?

DEXTER
I’ll apply for a business license
first thing in the morning.

RITA
Thanks for doing this, Dexter. You
know, I moved from Michigan with
dreams of fruit trees in my yard.

CODY
But they keep dying.

Astor holds up three fingers and mouths “Three” to Dexter.

RITA
I can’t help it.   I kill things.

DEXTER
That must be awful. Fortunately, I
have a green thumb. The secret to
happy citrus is in the fertilizer. I
find that bone meal works best.

CLOSE on ratty sneakers tromping across a yellow lawn. TILT
UP to reveal FRANKIE, 30s, a degenerate friend of Rita’s ex.
Rita instinctively pulls her kids close as he marches up.

RITA
Paul doesn’t live here anymore.

FRANKIE
No shit, he’s in jail. But he still
owes me for fifty grams of blow, which
means you owe me.

As Dexter curiously steps over, Rita holds up a hand.

RITA
Don’t get involved.

6   CONTINUED: (2)                                                6

DEXTER (V.O.)
I’m supposed to get involved?    I never
know in these situations.

Rita, scared, turns to Frankie.

RITA
I don’t have money.

Frankie indicates the Toyota RAV4 parked in the driveway.

FRANKIE
You have a car.

RITA
(disbelief)
My car...?

FRANKIE
(snaps fingers)
Keys.

Rita doesn’t know what to do.    Cody innocently looks up.

CODY
You know my dad?

Frankie squats down to Cody’s level and smiles.

FRANKIE
Why I sure do, little man. And you
look just like him. I’ll tell him you
said hi, okay?

Frankie reaches to tousle Cody’s hair, but Rita pulls her
son close, out of Frankie’s reach. With a knowing smile,
Frankie rises to his feet and gets serious.

FRANKIE
Look... you want I could go into your
house and throw around your furniture,
make a real mess. But what kind of
message would that send to the little
ones? Just give me your fucking car.

Dexter knows better than to challenge this guy with the kids
around. He calmly turns to Rita, who’s near tears.

DEXTER
Maybe you should go get the keys.
I’ll wait here with our friend.

6   CONTINUED: (3)                                                   6

Rita nods and herds the children inside. Frankie turns and
stares daggers at Dexter, an imposing figure, holding the
shovel in his hands.

FRANKIE
What?    Think you can take me?

DEXTER (V.O.)
In my sleep.

Off Dexter’s innocent expression --

MOMENTS LATER

Frankie recklessly backs down the driveway in the RAV4,
bounces over a curb and speeds away. Dexter watches him go.

7   INT. RITA’S HOUSE - BATHROOM - DAY 2                                7

Rita sits on the toilet peeing and crying. She reaches into
a vanity drawer mirror for a rubber band, pulls it onto her
wrist, and starts snapping it. She hears a KNOCK.

INTERCUT:

8   INT. RITA’S HOUSE - HALLWAY - DAY 2 (CONTINUOUS)                    8

Dexter stands outside the bathroom door.

DEXTER
Everything okay in there?

RITA
Yes.

Dexter really wants to help but isn’t exactly sure how.
DEXTER
Do you need toilet paper?

RITA
No.

DEXTER
(beat)
He’s gone.

Rita dries her eyes, flushes the chain, and adjusts her
skirt. She opens the door to find Dexter standing there.

DEXTER
Guy clearly had no idea who he was
dealing with. I’ll file a report at
work and get your car back.

8   CONTINUED:                                                  8

Rita subconsciously pulls her sleeve over the rubber band.

RITA
No, Dexter -- thanks. No reports.
Paul’s out of our lives, I’ve filed
for divorce... I just want my past to
go away.

DEXTER
It went away in your RAV4.

RITA
Whatever it takes.

DEXTER
Okay, well -- I can give you a ride to
work until you get another car.

Rita slips her arm through Dexter’s and heads outside.

RITA
Or, I can take the bus like millions
of other people. Now c’mon, let’s go
outside and enjoy this beautiful day.

Off Rita forcing an impossibly hopeful smile --

9   INT. POLICE STATION - DEXTER’S LAB - DAY 2 (MORNING)            9

CLOSE on a BLOOD SPATTER PHOTO that shows a vertical arc of
crimson blood stretching up a wall. Dexter and ANGEL
BATISTA discuss the photo, pinned on a bulletin board.

DEXTER
That’s not arterial spurting. The
drops are elliptical in shape. They
were cast off by a weapon, something
the killer swung overhead.

BATISTA
Like, what?    An axe?

DEXTER
Blunt force. See how the head’s caved
in on the left side?

As Dexter shows Batista a CRIME SCENE PHOTO, VINCE MASUKA
enters the work area.

MASUKA
You guys scope out the new Hottie
McHotass in dispatch yet?

BATISTA
(dismissing)
She’s a Butter Face.

DEXTER
What’s a Butter Face?

BATISTA
You know, compa. She’s got a hot
body, “but her face.”

MASUKA
Yeah, but how great to pull a Bronco
on that one, yeah? Yeah?

Dexter just stares at them blankly.   Batista explains --

BATISTA
Mira aquí. You do her doggy style,
right? Just when she gets into it,
you grab her hips and yell another
woman’s name. Bam, you’re riding a
bronco ‘cause she’s trying to buck you
off.

Masuka, getting into the spirit of things, lets out a holler
and pretends to ride. Dexter can only stare in amazement.

DEXTER (V.O.)
Many times in life, I feel like I’m
missing some essential piece of the
human puzzle. This is one of them.

Debra runs up, looking for Dexter, and sees Masuka.

DEBRA
What’re you doing -- the Bronco?

BATISTA
(to Dexter)
See socio, she knows.

Debra excitedly turns to Dexter.

DEBRA
I got my first official homicide call!
He’s back!

DEXTER
(hoping beyond hope)
Who’s back? The Ice Truck Killer?

DEBRA
That’s right, and you’re not gonna
believe where he left the body.

10   EXT. MIAMI - AERIAL VIEW (STOCK) - DAY 2 (MORNING)             10

An AERIAL SHOT circles a giant Sports Arena.

11   INT. SPORTS ARENA - LOBBY - DAY 2 (MORNING)                    11

Dexter, craning his neck around in awe, enters the massive
indoor stadium, where the Miami Blades play hockey.

DEXTER (V.O.)
I knew he’d be back. It feels like
Christmas morning.

12   INT. HOCKEY ARENA - DAY 2 (MORNING)                            12

Dexter enters the expansive space, which looks even bigger
with the uniform rows of empty seats. SOUNDS of an active
murder scene echo across the cold, hard surfaces. Dexter
stops at the perimeter of the ice rink and peers through the
plexiglass with child-like wonder.

REVERSE ANGLE

Reveals a woman’s bloodless BODY PARTS, carefully wrapped in
butcher paper and stacked on ice inside the goalie net. The
brunette HEAD of the victim is perched ghoulishly atop the
pile. Crime scene PERSONNEL work the area.

DEXTER (V.O.)
(breathless)
Look at that, a miracle on ice. Any
jeweler will tell you that finding the
right setting is essential, but this --
it’s stunning.

AT THE HOCKEY NET

Batista and Masuka are already examining the body. Dexter,
struggling not to slip, crosses the ice and joins them.

DEXTER
You ever seen anything like this
before, Angel?

BATISTA
Guy’s an original.

MASUKA
Did you hear? They caught him.

DEXTER
(heartbroken)
The killer?

MASUKA
Yeah.
(points across the ice)
They sent him to the penalty box for
slashing.

Masuka laughs. Dexter nods -- “You got me” -- then turns to
stare at the body, mesmerized.

BATISTA
You all right, Dexter?

DEXTER
I am fantastic. This is like a dream.
(off their curious looks)
Standing on the home ice of the Miami
Blades.

BATISTA
Never pegged you for a hockey fan.

DEXTER
There’s something about sitting in a
big, cool hall I find very relaxing.
(then)
So what do we know?

MASUKA
(holding a severed leg)
Same as the others, no blood.

BATISTA
But... I’m not seeing any hesitation
cuts this time. No flayed bones. I
think our boy’s got his confidence
back.

Dexter cranes his head, looking around the inspiring arena
that engulfs them like a cathedral.

DEXTER
He never lost it. He was just getting
bored.

BATISTA
Wonder what he’s trying to tell us by
stuffing her body in a goalie’s net.

DEXTER
Hockey’s a violent sport?

BATISTA
Anything else?

DEXTER
(realizing)
He’s escalating the thrill. Posing
his victim in a 20,000-seat stadium
for all Miami to see. To show them,
show us, what he’s capable of doing.

Debra eagerly slips and slides her way across the ice to
join them and skids into Dexter, who catches her.

DEBRA
What’d I miss? What’d I miss?

DEXTER
Relax.   You’re not missing anything.

Masuka smiles and waves a SEVERED HAND at Debra.    The
FINGERTIPS have been sliced off.

MASUKA
But she is... fingertips.

DEBRA
Fucking A! That’s my girl!
(to Dexter)
This body belongs to the fingertips we
found frozen in the ice truck. Shari
Taylor. Another prostitute.

Dexter smiles proudly at his sister.

DEXTER
Well, no blood, no need for me.   I
should probably get going.

Doakes strides over, managing much better than Deb and Dex
did on the slick ice. He glowers at Dexter.

SGT. DOAKES
What are you smiling at, freak boy?

DEXTER
I’m not smiling. Just stretching my
face.

SGT. DOAKES
Well stop it.
(to Debra)
Meet me at the command post in five.
We may have a suspect.

Doakes walks away.    Intrigued, Dexter turns to Debra.

DEXTER
There’s really a suspect?

DEBRA
(a little cocky)
I’ll let you know, Bro. When I get
back from my first official homicide
investigation. Damn, it’s good to be
out of vice. I can’t wait to...

Her voice trails off when Masuka stands, WIPING FRAME to
reveal the SEVERED HEAD of the victim. Debra blanches.

DEBRA
I know her.

DEXTER
Shari?

DEBRA
She called herself Cherry. We worked
the same corner when I was undercover.
We had coffee together. She always
ordered hers black. Like her pimp.
(knowing it’s lame)
She thought that was funny.

DEXTER
So you and Cherry were, like, friends?

DEBRA
I guess.

Debra appears shaken, maybe even close to tears. Dexter has
compassion for his sister, but as a semi-sociopath he never
knows how to show it.

DEXTER
(sincere)
You want a hug?

DEBRA
(as if)
Fuck off.

Upset, she turns to go, slips a little, rights herself and
walks away.

13   INT. HOCKEY ARENA - THE STANDS - DAY 2 (MORNING)             13

LaGuerta has set up a command post halfway up the stands,
with a dramatic view of the ice below. Doakes briefs her.

SGT. DOAKES
...I tore apart the security office.
A surveillance tape’s missing.

LAGUERTA
Lemme guess, the one covering the ice.

SGT. DOAKES
They said you were good.

LAGUERTA
Don’t bust my balls, James. The press
is pounding on the doors outside.
Someone had to be here last night who
saw something. A rent-a-badge? A
cleaning crew? A crack whore in the
men’s room? Work with me.

SGT. DOAKES
They got a night watchman.    We can’t
find him.

LAGUERTA
Then he’s a suspect.

DEBRA (O.C.)
Unless the Ice Truck Killer abducted
him to gain entry into the arena.

They turn to see Debra coming up the stairs to join them.

LAGUERTA
Your brother help you with that
startling piece of deductive logic?

SGT. DOAKES
(to Debra)
It’s possible the watchman was in the
wrong place at the wrong time. That’s
why we need to get to his apartment,
see what we can find.

Debra turns to LaGuerta.   Takes a deep breath...

DEBRA
Actually, I was hoping I could hit
Calle Ocho. Talk to my old contacts.

LaGuerta folds her arms, loving this.

LAGUERTA
Well isn’t this a piss. I thought you
wanted to get out of vice.

LAGUERTA (CONT'D)
Isn’t that what you cried to the
Captain last week?

DEBRA
Yeah. I mean no, I didn’t cry. Look,
my girls know this victim, okay? They
may have information that could help
us.

LAGUERTA
(considers it, then --)
No.    I want you to stay with Doakes.

LaGuerta turns to go. Debra can’t believe it. Doakes is
caught in between, but he’s a detective first and foremost.

SGT. DOAKES
Maria.    She’s got contacts.

LaGuerta stops on the stairs and turns back. After shooting
Doakes an annoyed look for putting her on the spot, LaGuerta
glares at Debra.

LAGUERTA
You still got your tube top?

DEBRA
And my nipple clamps.

LAGUERTA
Don’t come back without information.

LaGuerta turns and walks away. Debra gives a small nod of
appreciation to Doakes, who nods back.

14   EXT. CALLE OCHO - STOREFRONTS - DAY 2                         14
A row of colorful storefronts -- all the flavors of Miami.
Dexter stands outside a curio shop with a table out front,
full of assorted second-hand knickknacks. Dexter holds up a
blown-glass POODLE to examine it.

DEXTER (V.O.)
Everyone moves to Miami to die, which
means we have more junk than any city
in America. A skilled bargain hunter
can find real treasure here -- Tiffany
lamps, Steuben glass -- but that’s not
my idea of hunting.

RACK FOCUS from Dexter’s POV of the poodle to REVEAL Jeremy,
walking up the sidewalk toward Dexter, window shopping.

DEXTER (V.O.)
I prefer a stalk and ambush approach.
My instincts are impeccable, but I
have to be sure of my prey.

Dexter curiously watches Jeremy stop to survey the wares of
a KNIFE VENDOR, 60s, a bit of a yahoo wearing an American
Eagle cap and surrounded by American flags. He has set out
a couple card tables with rows of shining KNIVES, all sizes
and shapes, floating on dark velvet.

KNIFE VENDOR
What’cha in the market for?   You hunt
trophies or meat?

JEREMY
Excuse me?

KNIFE VENDOR
Well, trophy hunters, they’re into the
raw adrenaline rush...
(redneck accent)
Kill it till it dies, Billy Bob!
(then)
Meat hunters are looking for dinner.
What’re you looking for?

JEREMY
Can I see that one?

Jeremy points to a SKINNING KNIFE with a 4-inch blade, not
the most impressive of the lot. The vendor takes the knife
and deftly shows it off like a birthday party magician.

KNIFE VENDOR
Good eye. Fixed-blade skinning knife.
Full-tang stainless steel. Real time
saver for hunters who like to do their
own butchering in the field.

Dexter drifts a little closer, as the knife vendor holds up
the skinning knife, which glints in the sunlight.

KNIFE VENDOR
See the way that blade curves gently,
son? Like an eagle’s talon. It’s
yours for fifteen dollars.

JEREMY
(pulls out a twenty)
I’ll take it.

KNIFE VENDOR
Hell yeah, you’ll take it. Why
wouldn’t you? I’ll get your change.

Jeremy delicately picks up the knife off the table to test
the weight, holding the handle with an expert backhand grip.
Abruptly, he SLASHES the empty air in front of him, once,
twice, then spins with the blade --

-- and a HAND catches his wrist, stopping him in midswing.
The hand belongs to Dexter, now standing next to Jeremy.
The knife hovers two inches from Dexter’s head. CLOSE on
Jeremy’s eyes -- cold, enraged, hungry.

DEXTER (V.O.)
There it is. The inhuman lizard-brain
sense of I-Want. I remember the first
time I saw that look.

Dexter stares at Jeremy with an odd sense of recognition.

DEXTER
Easy, kid.
The knife vendor turns to see Dexter holding off the knife.

KNIFE VENDOR
Hey -- what the Sam Hill?

Jeremy pulls his hand away.

JEREMY
I didn’t see him.

KNIFE VENDOR
(to Dexter)
You okay, sir?

DEXTER
I’m fine.    Honest mistake.   No harm.

The knife vendor hands Jeremy his change.

Jeremy takes off up the street, looking nervously over his
shoulder at Dexter. The knife vendor turns to Dexter.

KNIFE VENDOR
Sorry about that. I only sell ‘em.
So what’re you hunting? Trophies or
meat?

Off Dexter, watching Jeremy go --

CLOSE on HARRY, dressed for a hike, walking through thick
woods with 15-year-old TEENAGE DEXTER. They move in and out
of shadows as they talk.

TEENAGE DEXTER
You ever shoot anybody, Dad?

HARRY
Afraid so.

TEENAGE DEXTER
Any of ‘em die?

HARRY
Just one.

TEENAGE DEXTER
How’d it feel? To kill a guy?
Harry turns and fixes his son with a probing look.

HARRY
Not so great, Dex. When you take a
man’s life, you’re not just killing
him. You’re snuffing out all the
things he’ll ever become.

That reality hits Teenage Dexter.

HARRY
As a police officer, I only fire my
weapon to save a life. That’s a code
I live by. Killing has to serve a
purpose. Otherwise, it’s just plain
murder.

Harry sees something on the ground ahead.

HARRY
There it is...

They reach a FALLEN DEER, bleeding in the hindquarters from
where it was shot, but still breathing. For the first time,
we notice the RIFLE in Harry’s hands. Teenage Dexter stares
down.

TEENAGE DEXTER
It’s still alive.

Harry, troubled by his son’s questions, has an idea to help
the boy cope with his emerging instincts. Reluctantly, he
unsheathes a HUNTING KNIFE and hands it to Teenage Dexter.

HARRY
Why don’t you go ahead, son. Put the
poor animal out of its misery.

Teenage Dexter looks in wonder from his father to the
wounded deer.

TEENAGE DEXTER
Really?

HARRY
For now, this is how we’ll control the
urges you feel. Channel them.

Teenage Dexter takes the knife, barely believing. He steps
forward and kneels OUT OF FRAME. PUSH INTO Harry, hoping
this is a good idea...

HARRY
This deer will put meat on our table
tonight. It serves a purpose.

18   EXT. POLICE STATION - KITCHEN - DAY 2                         18

A tired Doakes fixes a cup of coffee. On the counter, he
notices a NEWSPAPER ARTICLE on the memorial for fallen
officer Ricky Simmons and his wife Kara, with separate
photos of each. Doakes picks up the story. PUSH IN on
KARA’s photo. As he stares at his slain lover, Doakes is
flooded with anger. It’s time to do something about this.

receiving hugs and handshakes from FAMILY MEMBERS.

Doakes scans the courtyard, until he spots --

ROSE, 15, Latino, awkward but beautiful, wearing a virginal
white gown. A Catholic BISHOP, 70s, full white hair and red
vestments, clasps her hand in his hands.

BISHOP
I’m very proud of you.   You worked
hard for this.

ROSE
Thank you, Bishop.

Rose smiles and steps away to find her friends -- but bumps
into Doakes, now strategically positioned in her path.

SGT. DOAKES
Hi, Rose. Congratulations on your
Confirmation.

ROSE
Thank you.   Do I know you?

SGT. DOAKES
My name’s James Doakes. Miami-Metro
PD. I’m investigating the murder of
an undercover officer and his wife.

ROSE
That’s terrible.    Were they members of
the church?

Rose couldn’t be sweeter or more innocent.
SGT. DOAKES
No, Rose.    They weren’t.

ROSE
(confused)
Oh?

Doakes pulls out a PHOTO of Ricky Simmons and holds it up.

SGT. DOAKES
Have you ever seen this man?

In the background, for the first time we see kingpin CARLOS
GUERRERO and his wife CELESTE, talking to other churchgoers.
A Guerrero ASSOCIATE urgently taps his boss on the shoulder
and points out Doakes.

GUERRERO
Hey!    Get away from my daughter!

Doakes turns to see Guerrero angrily racing over, pushing
people aside.

SGT. DOAKES
What?   C’mon...

Trying to provoke Guerrero into a fight, Doakes holds up his
hands, like “Take a shot.” Guerrero pushes people aside and
lunges at Doakes to do just that, but some of his associates
wisely hold him back. Guerrero strains to get to Doakes --

GUERRERO
At my church? In front of my family?

SGT. DOAKES
Ricky and Kara had families, too.

Everyone in the church has turned to watch.

ROSE
(scared)
What’s he saying, Daddy?

CELESTE
Come on, honey. Let’s go.

Celeste escorts away Rose. Guerrero forces down his fury,
shrugs off the associates holding him, and faces Doakes.

GUERRERO
You just opened a dangerous door.

SGT. DOAKES
Naw, man. You did. When you murdered
a cop. And an innocent lady. You
don’t follow the rules, Guerrero. Why
should I?

The Bishop calmly approaches.

BISHOP
This is a place of worship, officer.
I need to ask you to leave. Go in
peace.

Not likely.

Little Havana. The heart of Cuban Miami. A time warp into
an alternate reality of hand-rolled cigars, fruiterias, meat
markets, and windows with cafecitos for only 25 cents.

At a corner traffic light, four motley hookers in slinky
dresses and strappy heels -- SHANDA (Black, attitude),
GABRIELLE (Latino, trashy), BELLA (Latino, demure), and a
FOURTH HOOKER -- lift their skirts to display their wares.
Appreciative drivers HONK.

Debra, wearing her business suit, approaches the girls on
the street. They turn and break out familiar smiles.

SHANDA
Yo, looks who’s back!

BELLA
Mamacita!     Estás caliente!

GABRIELLE
Who’d you fuck? Dolce or Gabbana?

DEBRA
I let ‘em both pull a train on me.

The girls laugh.

DEBRA
Listen, I have a confession to make...
I’m, uh... I’m not who you think I am.
I’m a cop.

The girls look at each other nervously. The Fourth Hooker
turns and bolts, doing her best to run in high heels.

DEBRA
(calls after her)
Bridget, get back -- I’m not gonna
bust you! Bridget!

But she’s gone.    The others size up Debra, not buying it.

GABRIELLE
You’re not a cop, you’re a whore.

relax after a hard week and meet friends to talk politics,
sports or gossip. CUBAN MUSIC plays on a cheap boombox.

Debra sits with the three hookers over beers. Bella is
still tearful. Some CUBAN MEN at the bar eye the girls.

GABRIELLE
This shit’s too crazy, I’m done. I

SGT. DOAKES
As you all know, a night watchman from
the hockey arena’s missing. Till now,
we presumed he was abducted, or worse,
by the Ice Truck Killer.

Doakes nods to someone offscreen, and a grainy SURVEILLANCE
VIDEO starts playing on the HUGE SCREEN behind Doakes. The
tape shows a MAN in a security uniform hauling chopped BODY
PARTS across the ice and stacking them in the goalie’s net.

SGT. DOAKES
However, we searched his apartment and
found a stolen surveillance tape from
the night of the murder. Chief of
security at the arena confirmed it...
the man you’re looking at is Tony
Tucci, the missing night watchman.

Tucci, a simple blue-collar type.

LAGUERTA
Ladies and gentleman, I give you Tony
Tucci... the Ice Truck Killer.

DEBRA

Bullshit.

LAGUERTA
Captain Matthews is coordinating with
the FDLE to launch a statewide manhunt
as soon as we get clearances.

DEBRA

Tucci. What kind of car’s he drive?

I don’t recall asking for questions,
Miss Morgan. Thank you.

Your individual assignments will be

Good thing. Just this morning I was

six. Sent to a foster home where the
man of the house sexually abused him.

LAURA
Happens more than you want to know.

Your department got him out of there
faster than you can say Jacko, thank

Yeah but the damage was probably done.
Lemme guess -- he got bounced from

A major crime. Murder.     You’re good.

You should keep the faith. The system

Dexter and Debra, both early 20s, stand over a hospital bed.
Harry, looking green against the sheets, lies with his eyes
closed, hooked up to an IV. A sturdy nurse named MARY --

He is getting better, sweetie.   A body
cannot suffer in sweet repose.

She pushes a nurse’s cart out, past an unconscious OLD
PATIENT in the next bed. Annoyed, Debra calls after Mary.
DEBRA
What does that mean?
(to Dexter)
What the hell’s that mean?

DEXTER
That she’s weird?

Harry opens his eyes and rolls his head toward his children,
as if some invisible hand pushed it from the far side of the
pillow.

HARRY
Listen you two, I’m not gonna be
around much longer.

DEBRA
Dad, stop. You can make it through
this. If you fight.

Debra’s grief can be seen in the tears she angrily brushes
back. Dexter holds his pain inside.

HARRY
I am fighting, honey. With every
breath.
(to Dexter)
When I’m gone, I can’t stop you...
from being who you are. Sooner or
later, you’ll -- need -- to do it.

Dexter nods, scared.   But Debra has no idea what Harry is
talking about.

DEBRA
Do what?

HARRY
(to Dexter)
Just remember our lessons.

DEBRA
What lessons? What’re you talking
about?

HARRY
(to Debra)
I never worried about you, Debra. You
got your mom’s spirit. But Dexter, he
required extra handling.

DEXTER
(simply)
I can’t make it without you.

HARRY
Yes you can. If you feel like you’re
slipping, you lean on your sister.
She’ll keep you... connected. You’re
a better person than you think, Dex.

As Dexter wonders if that’s really true --

REVEAL Batista closely watching the tape on a TV set in the
mostly empty bullpen. Debra enters with her nose in a FILE.

DEBRA
Fucking forensics report.

BATISTA
What’d they find?

DEBRA
Tucci’s hair and fibers.

She looks at the TV screen to see Tucci holding the victim’s
WRAPPED TORSO.

DEBRA
Of course his hair and fibers are on
the body. He’s hauling her around
with his pork hands, isn’t he? Pretty
fucking peculiar behavior for a genius
serial killer, if you ask me.

Disgusted, she tosses the file onto a desk.

DEBRA
Any word from the chem lab?

BATISTA
Same as the other bodies. The killer
used liquid nitrogen to preserve the
tissue. Give it that bleached look.

DEBRA
And they still think it’s Tucci?
Unbelievable.
BATISTA
Yeah, you know how unstable liquid
nitrogen is? You gotta be a serious
lab rat to mess around with that shit.
Tucci didn’t even pass high school
chemistry.

DEBRA
So wait -- you agree with me?   About
Tucci?


BATISTA
Why do you think I’m going over this
surveillance tape?

Intrigued, Debra moves over to Batista, who hasn’t taken his
eyes off the TV screen the whole time.

BATISTA
Come here.   Watch carefully.

Deb stares at the screen. As Tucci places the wrapped torso
inside the net, he subtly TURNS HIS HEAD as if responding to
someone off screen, then adjusts the position of the torso.

BATISTA
You see that? Right before he
repositioned the torso?

DEBRA
(excited)
He turned his head!

Batista rewinds and FREEZES FRAME on the head turned back.

BATISTA
Like someone’s giving him directions.

DEBRA
Someone like the Ice Truck Killer
holding a mother-fucking gun on his
back. The killer’s framing Tucci!

BATISTA
Looks that way.

DEBRA
LaGuerta’s gonna lose her sheep shit
when she finds out. She’s gonna have
to cancel her press conference.

BATISTA
And you know how LaGuerta loves her
press conferences.

Can I borrow this tape?

29   EXT. HOMESTEAD HALFWAY HOUSE - DAY 3 (DUSK)                  29

A rundown boarding house with a sign that says: “Welcome to
Homestead Halfway House.” Jeremy and a somewhat frail boy
named LUCAS -- an 18-year-old runt of the litter -- exit the
house joking and laughing.

CLOSE on the faces of Jeremy and Lucas behind chain-link. A
REVERSE ANGLE reveals that they’re staring into a secluded,
marshy area. A “NO TRESPASSING” sign on the fence.

LUCAS
I don’t know, Jeremy.

Lucas looks nervous.

JEREMY
What’s wrong? I thought you wanted to
see an alligator.

LUCAS
I do.

JEREMY
Well come on, it’s in the marsh.
(impatient)
You pussing out?

LUCAS
No.

WAY DOWN THE STREET

A familiar car sits under a tree.

32   INT. DEXTER’S CAR - DAY 3 (DUSK)                              32

Dexter sits inside, shadowing Jeremy. He watches as Lucas
overcomes his fear and starts climbing the chain-link to
break into the marsh. Dexter raises binoculars for a better
look.
LONG-LENS POV

As Jeremy climbs, his shirt lifts and Dexter spots the GLINT
of the skinning knife strapped to Jeremy’s hip.

DEXTER (V.O.)
Bingo. I know what happens next in
this gruesome little scenario. Jeremy
is trying to recreate his first kill,
ritualize it. I’ve got what I need.

As Dexter puts his binoculars back in the case, PAN to the
front window, through which we see the boys in the distance
clear the high fence and run off into the marsh.

Debra shows CAPTAIN MATTHEWS the security tape FREEZE FRAMED
on Tucci’s turned head.

DEBRA
See the look on his face? Like he’s
scared. Like he’s got a gun pointed
at him.

CAPTAIN MATTHEWS
It’s not much to go on, Debra.     A look
off camera?

DEBRA
There’s more, one of my vice contacts,
Gabrielle, I trust her, and she saw
the victim get into a panel wagon the
night of her death. That was the last
time anyone saw the victim.

Debra, on a roll, hands a file to the Captain.

DEBRA
I checked Tucci’s background report.
He doesn’t even own a car. I’m
telling you, there’s no fucking way he
can be the Ice Truck Killer.
(catching herself)
Sir.

Captain Matthews appears impressed, but circumspect.

CAPTAIN MATTHEWS
What’s Lieutenant LaGuerta think of
all this?
DEBRA
I came straight to you, Captain.

CAPTAIN MATTHEWS
(frowning)
You went around the back of your
commanding officer?

DEBRA

I gave you a shot in homicide because
I think you can make a halfway decent

Yes, sir.

Captain Matthews turns to go, then pauses --

34   EXT. MARSH - SWAMPY AREA - DAY 3 (DUSK)                        34

An extremely LOW ANGLE, an inch above water, gazing out over
the blackness of a swampy WATER HAZARD. On the far side,
close to the water, stand Jeremy and Lucas. It all feels
creepy.

LUCAS
I don’t see it.

Jeremy points right INTO CAMERA.

JEREMY
It’s right there. See its eyes
sticking up?

AT THE WATER’S EDGE

Lucas looks into the murky water.     Jeremy stands slightly
behind him.

JEREMY
You have to get closer.

Lucas nervously steps right to the water’s edge. Any closer
and he’d fall in. Lucas looks out over the water.

LUCAS
I still don’t see it.

JEREMY
Really?   Huh. Maybe I was wrong.

Lucas looks back at the bigger boy, suddenly realizing.

LUCAS
There’s no gator here, is there?

Jeremy shrugs.    Dark.   Menacing.

JEREMY
I don’t know, Lucas.    Is there?

It’s a tense, uncomfortable moment. Lucas is helpless.       He
knows it. We know it. Jeremy smiles, the smile of a
predator in control --

VOICE
Excuse me!

They turn to see Dexter materializing out of the trees as he
walks toward them. He strolls right up to the boys, who are
frozen by his sudden appearance.

DEXTER
Anyone see a Frisbee?   It flew in here
somewhere.

Jeremy impulsively takes off running. Lucas follows a beat
behind. Dexter watches the boys run away. After they flee
from sight, he looks around at his surroundings.

DEXTER (V.O.)
What am I doing out here?

Dexter is about to head back, when he hears a SPLASH behind
him. Dexter turns -- as a 12-FOOT ALLIGATOR lunges out of
the water. Dexter leaps away but trips, falls, and quickly
scrambles back to his feet.

DEXTER
Son of a bitch!

Dexter, angry and wet, limps across the empty parking lot.

DEXTER (V.O.)
All I had to do was drive home. Have
a taco. Plan my attack. Instead,
dearly deluded Dexter tried to act
human. Like it’s my job to save
lives.

He reaches his car -- to find the passenger window SMASHED.
Oh hell. Dexter opens the door and more glass falls from
the window. Dexter checks the glove box. Emptied out.

DEXTER (V.O.)
The Code of Harry never covered this.

CLOSE ON a hypodermic needle filling up with liquid. The
needle slowly rises to face of Mary, who’s holding the
syringe. She squirts out the air bubble. RACK FOCUS to
Harry, lying behind her in bed, looking very close to death.

HARRY
(very faint)
Wait...

FIND Dexter sitting on the edge of the bed. Dexter turns to
his dying father to see a small spark shining in his eyes.

DEXTER
What Dad?

HARRY
Don’t let her...

Mary, not hearing Harry (or ignoring him), turns with the
needle and gently lifts Harry’s frail arm.

MARY
Okay, my brave little soldier.   Let’s
get this nasty shot over with.

HARRY
No... no shot...

Dexter sees the horror in his father’s eyes. Just before
Mary plunges the needle into Harry’s raised blue vein,
Dexter reaches out and restrains her arm.

DEXTER
Wait.

In SLOW MOTION, Mary’s eyes snap to Dexter and fix him with
a look of cold rage. It mirrors the rage we watched earlier
in Jeremy’s eyes. Dexter registers the look, before we
RESUME NORMAL SPEED and Mary breaks out a granola smile.

MARY
What is it, honey?

DEXTER
He doesn’t want the shot.

She holds up the needle, and a melodramatic SHAFT OF LIGHT

MARY
He needs a shot.

Harry’s hand slowly reaches for Dexter’s hand and gives it a
squeeze. Dexter looks down at his frail father, fighting
his way up through the fog.

HARRY
I want... pain.

Dexter smiles and looks at Mary.

DEXTER
He wants pain.

Mary forces down a savage roar and replaces it with a
petulant shake of her head.

MARY
I’ll have to tell the doctor. He
won’t be happy that you’re refusing
your medication.

She turns on her heels and sails out into the hallway like
some large and deadly bird. Dexter looks back at Harry.

HARRY
You... can tell.
DEXTER
About the nurse? Yeah. She’s like
me. How could you tell?

HARRY
She gives... too much...
(he gasps in pain and
closes his eyes)
...too much morphine. It’s making me
worse.

HARRY
Stop her.

The woman is believed to be the latest
victim of the notorious Ice Truck
Killer, now responsible for five
deaths in the greater Miami area.

“Lt. Maria LaGuerta, Miami Metro Homicide.”

Dexter tries to get hold of the splinter with the tweezers.

Second cousin of the Tooth Fairy. She

She spots a classic Fleetline STATION WAGON, light color

Pulls up, blocking Debra’s line of sight. She runs around
the SUV and bolts into the street. A car SLAMS ITS BRAKES,

Debra holds up a hand, sorry, and races across the street,

She reaches the rear of the Fleetline Station Wagon stopped
at the light and hurries along the side, trying to peer in,
but the windows are tinted. When she reaches the passenger
window, which is rolled down, Debra looks inside --

his AGED WIFE riding shotgun. She smiles a creepy toothless
smile at Debra and waves in SLOW MOTION, as the light turns

McNamara and the cops exit the car WEARING THEIR MASKS.

44   EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - NIGHT 4 (CONTINUOUS)                44

Doakes follows the cops out, still holding his mask.

SGT. DOAKES
Yo listen up, I showed my face to
Guerrero, man. To his whole church.
He’s gonna think I was behind this.

One clown jumps up and down, testosterone flowing.

COP FRIEND
That’s part of the plan, dumb-ass.

SGT. DOAKES
(confused)
The plan?

McNamara puts a friendly arm around Doakes.

DET. MCNAMARA
You fuck my sister. You fuck a cop’s
wife. Now...
(he starts laughing)
...you’re just fucked, buddy.

The other clowns join McNamara in derisive laughter as they
turn like three linebackers from a huddle and bound up the
walkway toward the house, leaving a tortured Doakes by the
car. He hears the door BUST OPEN, furniture THROWN, then a
man YELLING.
SGT. DOAKES
Shit, man.

Doakes throws the clown mask into the car, backs away, then
turns and hurries down the sidewalk. As CRIES OF PAIN and
SOUNDS OF A BEATING echo behind him --

45   EXT. HOMESTEAD HALFWAY HOUSE - NIGHT 4                        45

The rundown boarding house is mostly dark. We hear the
SOUNDS of a classic arcade game, along with a current
ALTERNATIVE MUSIC song.

46   INT. HOMESTEAD HALFWAY HOUSE - RECREATION ROOM - NIGHT 4      46

An UNSEEN POV creeps along the back wall of a drab and faded
rec room with a “Homestead Halfway House” sign.

46   CONTINUED:                                                 46

Its shabby contents include a ping pong table with a sagging
net, a weathered foosball table, and an donated community TV
bolted high in the corner of the room, playing a fuzzy MUSIC
VIDEO.

On the far side of the rec room, we see Jeremy playing a
1980s arcade machine, like Centipede, with his back to us.

CLOSE on Jeremy. As he struggles with the game, the LIGHTS
and TV go out, plunging the room into shadows and darkness.
Jeremy turns around, more bored than scared.

JEREMY
Quit fucking around!   Turn on the
lights!

Beat. Jeremy starts feeling a little nervous. He steps
away from the machine, deeper into the room, his eyes
searching.

JEREMY
Come on, man. Turn on the fucking --

From seemingly nowhere, a FAMILIAR SHADOW blindsides Jeremy,
who lets out a reflexive grunt, and pile-drives him into a
column. REVEAL Dexter, the real Boogey Man, holding Jeremy
firmly from behind. He leans close, whispers menacingly.

DEXTER
You’re mine now.

JEREMY
(terrified)
What do you want?

DEXTER
Silence.

Dexter SLAMS his body into Jeremy, flattening the boy’s face
against the column, so that he can pull the SYRINGE from his
jacket pocket. As he raises it to Jeremy’s neck --

JEREMY
(acting tough)
You gonna fuck me, faggot? ‘Cause I
killed the last guy who raped me.

Shocked, Dexter pauses with the needle hovering.

DEXTER
What guy?

46   CONTINUED: (2)                                             46

Jeremy, afraid, doesn’t say anything. Dexter lowers the
syringe with one hand and forcefully spins Jeremy around
with the other, so he’s looking into his eyes. No time for
bullshit here.

DEXTER
He raped you? The boy you killed when
you were fifteen?

Jeremy, his face lit by a SHAFT OF LIGHT beaming through a
high window, struggles valiantly not to cry.

DEXTER
Why didn’t you tell someone?

JEREMY
(burning with shame)
Would you? He fucked me and I killed
him and if you try I’ll kill you, too.

Despite Jeremy’s best effort, tears start rolling down his
face. Dexter stares at his victim with sudden realization.

DEXTER (V.O.)
I understand now. Why didn’t I see it
before? Jeremy didn’t murder that boy
four years ago...

Jeremy suddenly TRANSFORMS into Teenage Dexter, and for an
instant, Dexter holds his own young life in his hands.

DEXTER (V.O.)
...he was taking out the garbage.
Just like I do.

Young Dexter TRANSFORMS BACK to Jeremy. Dexter, rattled,
slides the lethal syringe into his pocket without Jeremy
ever seeing it. He doesn’t, however, loosen his grip around
the kid’s neck.

DEXTER
(still scary)
Look, I really don’t wanna cancel all
my credit cards, and I hate waiting in
line at the DMV, so give me the wallet
you stole from my car -- or I’ll break
your fucking neck.

JEREMY
In my backpack.

Dexter lets go of Jeremy and unzips his backpack. As Dexter
digs for his wallet, Jeremy watches Dexter, trying to figure
out who this guy is and what he’s about.

46   CONTINUED: (3)                                                46

Dexter finds his wallet, tosses the backpack to Jeremy, and
walks out of the room. Jeremy can’t believe it.

47   INT. HOMESTEAD HALFWAY HOUSE - HALLWAY - NIGHT 4              47

Jeremy catches up to Dexter about to leave the building and
calls after him.

JEREMY
Is that all?

Dexter stops and turns back to Jeremy. An overhead LAMP
holds them both in a pool of light, with the rest of the
area fading dramatically into darkness.

DEXTER
You want more?

Jeremy nervously shakes his head no.   Dexter stares at him
for a beat.

DEXTER
That boy who raped you four years ago.
Did he deserve to die?

Jeremy thinks and then nods with unerring certainty.

JEREMY
Yeah... he did.

DEXTER
Well, the boy last night didn’t.
Remember that. It might save your
life one day.

With that, the Boogey Man turns to go.    As he walks INTO
CAMERA, showing no emotion --

FLASHBACK:

48   INT. ONE-BEDROOM APARTMENT - NIGHT                            48

The back kitchen door opens and Mary enters, dressed in her
hospital wear. She deadbolts the door behind her, sets down
her purse, and looks around.

MARY
Mr. Tinker?    Where are you, Mr.
Tinker?

She hears a faraway MEOW.

MARY
Mr. Tinker?

(CONTINUED)

48   CONTINUED:                                                 48

Mary walks through the dark, shadowy kitchen. It’s a sweet
place really, full of cute and craftsy knickknacks, but they
only add to the building sense of dread. Mary hears another
MEOW.

MARY
Are you hiding behind the couch again,
Mr. Tinker Stinker?

She walks toward the living room and sees --

MARY’S POV

Every conceivable inch of the living room, from floor to
ceiling and everything between, is covered in PAINTER’S
PLASTIC. The clear polyethylene film makes everything in
the room appear both shiny and blurry, like a dream of a
room. Sitting atop the plastic-covered couch is MR. TINKER,
who MEOWS.

MARY

Only has a confused and horrified beat to take all of this
in -- before twentysomething Dexter MATERIALIZES from the
shadows behind her. But Mary hears him and turns to see
Dexter wearing a surgical mask, gloves and cap, and holding
up a SYRINGE, just like the one she was using on Harry.

There’s a surprised, awkward beat -- before Dexter plunges
the needle into Mary’s neck. But before he can press the
plunger, the big-boned Mary twists free and yanks the needle
from her neck.

The terrified Mary opens her mouth to scream -- but Dexter
tackles her to the ground before she can make a sound and
covers her mouth with his hand. As the two awkwardly roll
around on the plastic --

DEXTER (V.O.)
Things were a little messy in the
beginning. Hey, perfecting a new
craft takes time. But I was trained
well. Those who witnessed my early
stumbles never had a chance to tell.

Unable to get Mary under control, Dexter, palm still firmly
over her mouth, finally grabs her head with both hands and
SLAMS it into the floor. ONCE. TWICE. BLACK.
DEXTER 103   "Popping Cherry"     Final Draft - 06/23/06      53.


49   FADE FROM BLACK - A SHORT TIME LATER                          49

Mary stirs awake to find herself lying naked on her plastic-
covered dining table, wrapped tightly in clear plastic that
straps her arms to her side. Her mouth is stuffed with
thick wads of white gauze.

Wide eyed, Mary rotates her head to see Dexter sitting on a
dining room chair in surgical wear, flipping through a
frilly photo album full of OBITS FOR ELDERLY PATIENTS.

DEXTER
I’ve been reading through your photo
album. Hope you don’t mind.

Panicked, she tries to speak, but it sounds like GRUNTS with
the gauze in her mouth. Dexter indicates the album.

DEXTER
Are all your victims in here?
(off her GRUNTS)
I’m sorry, let me help you with that.

Dexter starts to remove the gauze, then pauses, remembering
something. He pulls the SKINNING KNIFE from his youth out
of his pocket and holds it close to her face.

DEXTER
Scream.   And lose a tongue.

He removes the gauze.   Mary bursts into tears.

MARY
I helped them, all of them... They
were sick... I took away their pain.
DEXTER
(smiles)
I understand.

Dexter stuffs the gauze back into her mouth.

DEXTER
And now it’s time to take away your
pain. I’ve been waiting a very long
time for this.

Mary launches into a primal struggle against her bonds but
it’s useless. Dexter secured her well. He raises his knife
and looks over her body in anticipation, trying to decide
where to begin. PUSH INTO Dexter. As he makes his first
cut, blood spurts onto his chest. He looks down. That was
unexpected.

DEXTER (V.O.)
It was messier than I anticipated, but
still a special day. The Nurse was my
first playmate -- and I’ll always be
grateful to her for opening up so many
magnificent new doors for me.

As Dexter speaks, PAN to Mr. Tinker watching impassively
from atop the plastic-wrapped couch. Off the cat’s MEOW --

50   INT. HOSPITAL - HALLWAY - DAY                                 50

Twentysomething Debra bursts from the hospital room pushing
Harry in a wheelchair, his color and strength back again.

DEXTER (V.O.)
But of course it was really Harry,
wise and wonderful Harry, who paved
the road to my salvation.

A jubilant Debra spins Harry in a circle, laughing.

HARRY
For God’s sake, Debra. You’re gonna
put me right back in the hospital.

Dexter steps out of the hospital room. He leans against the
doorway and smiles, watching his father and sister together.

DEXTER (V.O.)
With the Nurse put down, Harry lived
another year before hardening arteries
squeezed the last bit of life from
him. But his lessons never failed me.

END FLASHBACK:
51   EXT. POLICE STATION - DAY 5                                   51

Doakes exits the police station. Across the street, he sees
a DANCING CLOWN -- with floppy shoes, a big nose, and full
face makeup -- waving around a HUGE SIGN that says “Condos
for Sale.”

DEXTER (V.O.)
Harry taught me that death isn’t the
end. It’s the beginning of a chain
reaction that will catch you if you’re
not careful.

As Doakes walks by staring, the Dancing Clown stops dancing.
He eerily looks Doakes in the eye, holds his fingers in the
shape of a gun, and fake fires at Doakes. A message from
Guerrero.

52   INT. CAFETERÍA - DAY 5                                        52

The down-low neighborhood joint we established on Calle
Ocho. LaGuerta sits on wooden chairs with a group of OLD
CUBAN MEN, smoking hand-rolled cigars and speaking Spanish.

DEXTER (V.O.)
He taught me that none of us are who we
appear to be on the outside. But we
must maintain appearances to survive.

LaGuerta laughs with the old men. Just one of the guys. In
the corner, nobody even notices the big TV with a NEWSCAST
of LaGuerta talking about the Ice Truck Killer.

53   EXT. RITA’S HOUSE - YARD - DAY 5                              53

CLOSE ON a stream of water. PULL BACK to find lovely Rita
watering the vibrant new LEMON TREE in front of her house.

DEXTER (V.O.)
But there was something Harry didn’t
teach me. Something he didn’t know.
Couldn’t possibly know.

On the sidewalk, Astor and Cody sit behind a crude homemade
Lemonade Stand with a pitcher of ice-cold lemonade and cups.

DEXTER (V.O.)
The willful taking of life represents
the ultimate disconnect from humanity.

The family hears a CAR HORN play “Hallelujah” and they turn
to see Dexter pulling into the driveway in a 1970s Cadillac
convertible, pimped out with chrome spinners and airbrushed
artwork, including a sanguine picture of Jesus on the hood.
DEXTER (V.O.)
It leaves you an outsider. Forever
looking in. Searching for company to
keep.

CLOSE on Dexter’s keys hanging from the ignition -- with the
BARBIE DOLL HEAD from the Ice Truck Killer attached as a
keychain.

Astor and Cody and Rita run over to check out the car, which
says “Christo Salva” on the back. Dexter gets out to greet
them.

CODY
Sweet ride.

ASTOR
Is it yours?

DEXTER
Actually it’s yours. Until your mom
can afford a new one.
(to Rita)
Borrowed it from impound. Right
before auction.

He slips the key off the Barbie Doll Head keychain and hands
it to a misty-eyed Rita.

RITA
Dexter...

CODY
Can we get in?

DEXTER
You better.

Dexter watches the overjoyed children hop into the car and
feel the red-velvet seats.

DEXTER (V.O.)
All you can do is play along at life
and hope that sometimes you get it
right.

Dexter looks back at the luminous Rita, who is staring at
him, touched beyond words.

RITA
Thank you...
Her eyes brim with tears as she kisses Dexter.

DEXTER (V.O.)
Score one for the little wooden boy.

Dexter puts his arm around Rita and they turn to watch the
kids playing with the FUZZY CROSS that hangs from the rear
view. Off this fractured family tableau --

FADE OUT.
