DEXTER
"Shrink Wrap"
FADE IN:
OVER BLACK we hear the howling of WIND.
DEXTER (V.O.)
I've always felt safer in the dark.
A NARROW FLASHLIGHT BEAM REVEALS:
—   SPLASHES OF BLOOD on crisp white tile —
DEXTER (V.O.)
In the dark, secrets are easier to
keep.
— A GUN on a blood-soaked bath rug, red spreading into plush
white softness —
DEXTER (V.O.)
In the light, you can't control
what people see. They say they
want the truth, but —
— A NAKED WOMAN in an empty jacuzzi-eized bathtub, a PINK AND
RED BURST of brains splattered on the otherwise pristine tub.
DEXTER (V.O.)
Usually, the truth is pretty ugly.
BATISTA (O.C.)
It's like a horror flick.
The light finds BATISTA, looking at the body.    REVEAL WE'RE:
INT. WEALTHY HOME - BATHROOM - NIGHT 1
Modern minimalist. Except for some strangely shaped pieces
of blown glaBB.
BATISTA
Tropical storm. Power outage.
Naked dead chick in the Jacuzzi.
The beam swings around, lighting DEXTER from under his chin.
DEXTER
/HP3K
All we need is a psycho killer.

BATISTA
Not tonight. This one looks like a
suicide.
DEXTER
I wouldn't be so sure. Firearm
suicides are usually committed by
men. Women tend to slit their
wrists. Take pills. Something
more lady-like.
BATISTA
Okay, but women kill themselves
twice as often as men do. Odds
are, she did this to herself.
DEXTER
I don't play the odds —   I need to
be sure.
A FORENSICS guy switches on a portable light stand,
illuminating the entire scene. Dexter surveys the blood
Bpatter pattern.
BATISTA
So?   What do you see?
DEXTER
I'd say... it's a rhinoceros. You?
BATISTA
Bunny rabbit. See the two ears?
Dexter smiles, moves around the crime scene, taking pictures.
DEXTER
Fancy bathtub. Rich husband?
BATISTA
(shakes his head no)
House-husband. "Aspiring artist."
He holds up a piece of blown glass. Dexter makes a face.
DEXTER
Promising.
(off Batista)
So she supported him?
BATISTA
f^                    (nodB)
Some kind of big time prosecutor.

>S?^Ns


Dexter pauses for a moment. Something's jogged his memory.
DEXTER
This is the third high-powered
woman to shoot herself in the last
two year8. That's got to be above
average.
DEXTER (V.O.)
Note to self...
BATISTA
(shrugs)
I only keep track of the homicides.
Dexter resumes taking pictures.
DEXTER
I will say, if she did this herself,
she was very considerate. Using the
bathtub makes for an easier cleanup.
BATISTA
Considerate? I would never, ever
^p^                    do something like this to my wife.
f                      Her husband's a wreck.
OFF THE BLOODY BODY —
INT. WEALTHY HOME - HALLWAY — NIGHT 1
The storm continues to toss and tumble outside.
Amidst the bustle of crime scene TECHS setting up lights and
gathering evidence, DOAKES talks to ALEX GAYLE, the victim's
sexy but blood-soaked husband. Alex is ten years younger
than his late wife. He can barely keep it together.
ALEX
I ran out to pick up some dinner.
Vanessa said she was going to take
a bath. But when I got back...
(tears forming)
I didn't know what to do. I tried
to give her CPR, but...
DOAKES
Did your wife have any problems
that you know of? Was she
x?r«v
depressed?
DEXTER 108   "Shrink Wrap"      Writer's Draft - 08/08/2006

jfSffRV,


ALEX
No.   No way.
(off Doakes)
Look, I know what this looks like.
But Vanessa would never, ever do
something like this to herself.
She had everything going for her.
DOAKES
High profile jobs can be stressful.
Maybe she cracked under the pressure.
ALEX
(shakes his head no)
Somebody killed her.
(off Doakes, skeptical)
I read the papers. People stage
suicides all the time. Maybe one
of the criminals she put away —
DOAKES
We'll check it out, okay? In the
meantime, we need to take some photos
for evidence. Standard procedure.
V             Doakes nods to the CRIME SCENE PHOTOGRAPHER who takes a photo
of Alex's bloody clothes. Off the FLASH of the camera —
INT. RUDY'S CAR - NIGHT 1
RUDY drops DEBRA off at the crime scene, lit mostly by
emergency vehicle bars. Wind whips the car and RAIN pounds
the windshield as Rudy puts the car in park. Debra reaches
for the door handle, but Rudy pulls her back for a kiBB.
DEBRA
(smiles)
C'mon, I gotta go. There'B a dead
body in that house.
RUDY
And there'8 a hot body in this car.
(eyes her)
This kind of weather makes me want
to stay inside. Order pizza. Pop
in a DVD. And not watch it.
The heat between them is palpable.
DEBRA
(/""1Bv                   I so want to maul you right now.

/$&£***»,

RUDY
I so wish you could. Come over
when you're done?
DEBRA
(smiles)
I'll bring my handcuffs.
She kisses him again. Grabs her umbrella and ducks out of
the car —
EXT. WEALTHY HOME - NIGHT 1
Debra walks backwards towards the crime scene, still watching
Rudy. She bumps into Doakes, who's exiting the house with
MASUKA.   They see her watching Rudy's car pull away —
DOAKES
How are things going with Mr.
Prosthetics?
MASUKA
Yeah — you riding the baloney pony?
She turns around, shoots them a look.
DEBRA
I don't fuck and tell.
DOAKES
Since when?
Debra smirks, flips him off.
MASUKA
Hey, does he know any hot amputees?
I've always wanted to hump a stump.
They look at him.   Freak. Debra turns to Doakes.
DEBRA
You gonna tell me why we're
standing out here getting wet?
(to Masuka)
Don't.
Masuka grins and heads back to the house.
DOAKES
I need you to canvass the
neighborhood. See what you can find
out about the vic's relationship with
her husband.
DEXTER 108   "Shrink Wrap"         Writer's Draft - 08/08/2006

/#**>
Dexter approaches, having exited the house.
DEXTER
It's always the husband, right?
DOAKES
Was I talking to you?
(to Debra)
It looks like a suicide, but you
never know. Younger guy.
Unemployed. Might be a boy toy who
killed her for her money.
DEBRA
I'm on it.
Doakes heads off. Dexter falls into step with Debra, who's
still happily buzzing over Rudy.
DEXTER
Doakes is sending you away from a
crime scene in the pouring rain, and
you're not putting up a fight?
DEBRA
I'm a team-player.
DEXTER
You are?
She playfully hip-checks him and heads off, kicking puddles
as she goes...
INT. RITA'S HOUSE - NIGHT 1
CLOSE ON A DOOR. It opens to reveal Dexter, wet and wind-
toSBed, fumbling with an umbrella in one hand and tray full
of hot chocolate in the other. He's unpleasantly surprised
to be greeted by PAUL.
PAUL
Dexter. Hey. Helluva blow-job.
(off Dexter — huh?)
The wind...?
(still nothing)
Nevermind. Come on in.
As Dexter enters, he sees the room is dimly lit by candles.
A COURT SUPERVISOR plays solitaire by candlelight.
DEXTER
Sorry, I thought your visit was
over at seven.
DEXTER 108   "Shrink Wrap"      Writer's Draft - 08/08/2006     7.


(                           COURT SUPERVISOR
It was supposed to be —
PAUL
Rita's stuck in traffic — power's out
in half the city. I'm thrilled to
stick around, but the Court
Supervisor? Not so much.
(off Dexter)
You want something to drink?
DEXTER
(re: hot chocolate)
I brought my own.
An awkward beat.
PAUL
Listen, I feel bad about the last time
we met. I was kind of a tool. Sorry.
(lowers his voice)
It'8 just... who wants to meet the
guy who's banging your wife while
you're in jail, you know?
(                          DEXTER
Yes. That would be awkward.
PAUL
But since Rita let it slip that you
guys aren't doing the bone dance,
I'm totally good with things.
The Court Supervisor titters from the couch.
PAUL
It's cool — I knew a bunch of gay
guyB in lock up.
DEXTER
Thanks for sharing, but I'm not gay.
PAUL
Seriously? But you and Rita have
been hanging out for like, a year.
What are you? A virgin?
Before Dexter can answer, RITA enters, shaking off the rain.
She kisses Dexter.
DEXTER 108   "Shrink Wrap"       Writer's Draft - 08/08/2006


RITA
Sorry I'm late.
(to Paul)
Thanks for holding down the fort.
The Court Supervisor approaches Rita —
COURT SUPERVISOR
Do you mind if I get going? I'm
happy to stay if you're not
comfortable, but I have kids of my
own to get home to.
RITA
That's fine. Dexter and I are
here, go ahead.
PAUL
Drive safely.
The Supervisor nods, exiting into the rain. ASTOR and CODY
run in, playing flashlight tag —
ASTOR
Mom!   Dexter! The lights are out!
DEXTER
They are?
(off their nods)
I brought you hot chocolate.
CODY
Dad already made us some.
(turns his light on Astor)
Tagl You're it!
And he takes off. Astor runs after him. Rita looks at Dexter,
feeling badly for him. She reaches for a cup.
RITA
I love hot chocolate.
PAUL
Take two. He has extra.
Cody slams into Paul's leg, hiding from Astor. Looks to Rita —
CODY
Mom?   Can Dad stay and put us to
bed?   Please?
DEXTER 108   "Shrink Wrap"      Writer's Draft - 08/08/2006


RITA
I think that's why Dexter's here,
Bweetie.
DEXTER
(he minds)
Dexter doesn't mind.
Cody lookB up with puppy-dog eyes. Rita can't bring herself
to say no.
RITA
Okay, but no stories, only a song.
It's way past your bedtime.
Cody's ecstatic, and even Astor gives a small smile. Paul
turns to the kids —
PAUL
Come on, guys — let's leave these
two alone.    It's not like they
need a chaperone...
He chases the kids to their room. Off Dexter, watching this,
/SJjSSSy    troubled...
INT. POLICE STATION - BULLPEN - DAY 2
CLOSE ON A PHOTO OF NEIL PERRY.
MAYOR ALLEN (O.C.)
So this is the Ice Truck Killer?
PULL OUT TO REVEAL — CAPTAIN MATTHEWS, standing in front of
the big board, a picture of Perry at its center. Matthews is
speaking to MAYOR ALLEN and the D.A.
MAYOR ALLEN
You actually got him to confess?
CAPTAIN MATTHEWS
That's right, Mr. Mayor. Neil Perry
is safely locked away until trial.
MAYOR ALLEN
Good. A serial killer on the looBe
isn't exactly a tourist attraction.
Debra approaches, overhearing.
DEBRA
No, but we could add Perry's trailer
to the Miami Crime Scene Tour.
DEXTER 108   "Shrink Wrap"       Writer's Draft - 08/08/2006    10.


MAYOR ALLEN
(smiles when he sees her)
Debra Morgan. Beautiful and smart.
Your father would be so proud.
(indicates Matthews)
Too bad Harry wasn't around to see
Frank here catch the bloodiest
killer in state history, huh?
Matthews smiles, and catches LAGUERTA shooting him the evil
eye from across the bullpen.
MATTHEWS
Just doing my civic duty.
LaGuerta approaches, extends her hand.
LAGUERTA
!                         Mr. Mayor —
,                                   MAYOR ALLEN
Good to see you, Lieutenant LaGorda.
LAGUERTA
It's LaGuerta.
MAYOR ALLEN
Right...
D.A.
Maria. When you get the chance, I
really need that D.A. worksheet
completed. I don't want any snafus
when we go to trial.
LAGUERTA
I'll get one of my detectives right
on it.
The Mayor nods, turns to the boys.
MAYOR ALLEN
C'mon, I'm dying for a donut. My wife
has me on this South Beach bullshit.
She thinks because we live in Florida,
it's a cultural obligation.
As the old boys club moves off, Debra turns to LaGuerta.
DEBRA
/#""*v                I can do the D.A. worksheet. I'll
^                     update the witness information and
evidence inventory, too.
DEXTER 108   "shrink Wrap"       Writer's Draft - 08/08/2006    11.


But LaGuerta isn't listening.
LAGUERTA
Fucking Matthews. I'm the one who
got Perry to confess, and he's got
the Mayor kissing his ass.
Angrily, she walks to her office and slamB the door. Masuka
sees this and passes, chuckling to himself as he heads to —
INT. POLICE STATION - BULLPEN/LAB AREA —     CONTINUOUS
Dexter goes over Vanessa Gayle's blood spatter photos with
Batista.
DEXTER
...Blood spatter's inconclusive.
All I can tell is that she was shot
at close range. Could have been
suicide, but could have been
someone who knew her.
BATISTA
I'll see what the ballistics guys
have to say about it.
Masuka enters, tosses a set of FILES on Dexter's deBk.
MASUKA
The photos you were asking about.
Why the sudden interest in cold
suicide cases?
DEXTER
Morbid curiosity.
Masuka shrugs. Moving on.
MASUKA
You guys totally missed it.
Matthews just douched LaGuerta,
bigtime.
DEXTER
I hope you're speaking
metaphorically, because that would
be a serious health code violation.
MASUKA
She's still got her tits in the
wringer about Neil Perry.
DEXTER 108   "Shrink Wrap"        Writer's Draft - 08/08/2006   12.


DEXTER
I don't know what she's so upset
about. Now Matthews will be the one
with egg on his face.
BATISTA
You still think Perry's the wrong
guy?
DEXTER
No doubt in my mind.
(off Batista)
I know you made the bust. But Perry's
trailer trash. The Ice Truck Killer's
got style. He'll kill again, it's
only a matter of time.
MASUKA
Or, if you're right, the real Ice
Truck Killer could use Perry as his
get out of jail free card. Skip town.
This hadn't occurred to Dexter. He reacts with concern.
DEXTER
You really think that could happen?
BATISTA
Not much we can do except wait and
see. Best case, if he's out there, he
won't kill again.
DEXTER
(visibly nervous)
Then how will we find him?
(off their looks)
I mean, after all this work, it'd
be a shame to let the guy get away.
MASUKA
First place I go when I need to
find something? Craigslist. They
got an ad for everything.
They're interrupted by A COURT OFFICIAL.
COURT OFFICIAL
Angel Batista?
BATISTA
f^^                That's me.     What can I do for you?
The Official hands Batista a manila envelope.
DEXTER 108   "Shrink Wrap"         Writer's Draft - 08/08/2006    13.

/f^N
COURT OFFICIAL
You've been served.
As the Official walks away, a bewildered Batista opens the
envelope. Masuka looks over his shoulder.
MASUKA
Divorce paperB?
And then —    silence in the bullpen. All eyes on Batista.
BATISTA
Thanks, amigo.
Batista exits, hurt and humiliated. Dexter turns to Masuka.
Unaffected.
DEXTER
People actually read Craigslist?
MASUKA
Hell, yeah. I get everything off
those ads. Pieces of furniture...
pieces of ass. One stop shopping.
OFF DEXTER, considering...
INT. DEXTER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 2
Dexter, bathed in moonlight, restlessly scavenges his freezer
for a snack. He scans containers of ice cream, but pauses on
the BARBIE DOLL PARTS instead.
DEXTER (V.O.)
What if Masuka's right? What if the
Ice Truck Killer disappears?
Dexter gently touches the Barbie mini-packages.
DEXTER (V.O.)
I can't just sit on my hands,
waiting for something to happen. I
need a distraction.
(grabs a pint of ice cream)
Nothing like a pint of Mint
Chocolate Chip and a worthy new
victim to clear out the old noggin.
INT. DEXTER'S APARTMENT - LATER (NIGHT 2)
/"^
[
Dexter sits on the floor eating ice cream from the container.
i
AUTOPSY PHOTOS and POLICE REPORTS of the suicide cases he
mentioned to Batista are spread out before him.
DEXTER 108   "Shrink Wrap"     Writer's Draft - 08/08/2006            14.


DEXTER (V.O.)
Meghan Brooks. Carolyn Jacobson.
And now Vanessa Gayle. All three
high powered women who shot
themselves in the past two years.
(he peruses the files)
They've got to have more in common
than career ambition and a fondness
of firearms.
And then Dexter spots the clue he's been looking for.
DEXTER (V.O.)
Fascinating. All three were seeing
the same psychotherapist — Dr.
Joseph Meridian. He's either
terrible at his job...
(realizing)
Or, he's killing them and making it
look like suicide.
He sits back and admires the files.
DEXTER (V.O.)
An almost perfect crime. He could
even vouch for the fact that they
were suicidal. Truly inspired.
And now, so am I.
Dexter rises, scraping the last bite out of the bottom of the
ice cream container.
DEXTER (V.O.)
I'd love to get a little face time
with the good doctor. But what do
I have to discuss with a therapist?
Dexter looks around his tidy apartment for inspiration. On
the BULLETIN BOARD over his desk, he spots: A NEWSPAPER
STORY. The headline reads: "TEEN KILLER TAKES LIFE IN
PRISON," over a photo of Jeremy Downs.
QUICKFLASH — Dexter discovers    the dead body of Jeremy,   lying
in a pool of blood in his prison cell (Episode   107).
DEXTER (PRELAP)
Thanks for squeezing me in.
INT. DR. MERIDIAN'S OFFICE - DAY 3
i^*v     Dexter now sits across from DR. JOSEPH MERIDIAN (55), a
silver-haired man with a warm face.
DEXTER 108   "Shrink Wrap"      Writer's Draft - 08/08/2006     15.


(                           DEXTER
I was worried I wouldn't get an
appointment on such short notice.
MERIDIAN
I keep 8lots open for emergencies.
Your message sounded urgent.
DEXTER
(nods)
I'm having trouble dealing with the
death of a friend. A suicide.
MERIDIAN
You came to the right place.
However, Mr. —
(checks APPOINTMENT BOOK)
Ellis. I have to tell you.
People's problems are rarely caused
by one event. True change comes
from digging deep, over a long
period of time.
Dexter considers.
(                            DEXTER
Well, I'm definitely hoping to dig
up Borne secrets.
Meridian smiles, satisfied with Dexter's answer.
MERIDIAN
Good. So, tell me about your
friend — what was his name?
DEXTER
Jeremy.   I was kind of... mentoring
him.
MERIDIAN
Do you feel responsible for what
happened to him, on some level?
DEXTER
I don't know, how do you feel when
a patient commits suicide?
Meridian doesn't take the bait. Just shows a gentle smile —
MERIDIAN
I didn't mean to put you on the
defensive. Why don't you just tell
me how you're feeling?
DEXTER 108   "Shrink Wrap"      Writer's Draft - 08/08/2006      16.


DEXTER
Oh, sad, I guess. Depressed.
Abandoned.
Meridian eyes Dexter.
MERIDIAN
Really? You feel all of those
things? Or those are the emotions
you think you're supposed to feel?
Beat.   On Dexter —   damn, this guy iB good.
DEXTER
Actually, I'm feeling kind of
parched.
MERIDIAN
Let me get you a glass of water.
Meridian exits. When Dexter's sure the coast is clear, he
rises quickly from his seat and Bteals a look at Meridian's
appointment book.
DEXTER (V.O.)
Vanessa Gayle's estimated time of
death was 7pm on Monday. According
to his calendar, Meridian was in
session with Harris Solomon.
Dexter grabs a pen, writes "Harris Solomon" on his hand. He
hears Meridian coming and quickly shuts the book. Returns to
his seat. Meridian hands Dexter his water —
MERIDIAN
Now. Let's talk about your real
feelings.
DEXTER
Quite frankly, I don't like to talk
about feelings.
(off Meridian)
Typical American male. Par for the
course.
Meridian smiles, amused.
MERIDIAN
Then let's talk about your romantic
life. Are you married?
DEXTER
I have a girlfriend. Rita.
DEXTER 108   "Shrink Wrap"      Writer's Draft - 08/08/2006   17.


MERIDIAN
And are you two close?
DEXTER
We spend a lot of time together, if
that'8 what you mean.
MERIDIAN
Actually, I was talking about
physical intimacy.
DEXTER
That's personal.
MERIDIAN
Therapy's a good place to talk
about personal things.
DEXTER
There's more to relationships than
sex.
MERIDIAN
So you're... not having sex?
DEXTER
We're waiting.
MERIDIAN
It'B rare in this day and age to wait
for marriage.
DEXTER
Oh, I'm not a virgin.
Meridian regards him.
MERIDIAN
Sometimes people don't want anyone to
get close to them. It's a way of
exercising control.
(beat)
Have you ever been truly close to
anyone?
Dexter considers.
DEXTER
Harry. My foster father. He's the
only one who ever really knew me.
MERIDIAN
Great. Tell me about Harry.
DEXTER 108        "Shrink Wrap"               Writer's Draft - 08/08/2006            18.



DEXTER
He's dead.

Meridian's surprised by Dexter's bluntness.

MERIDIAN
I meant, tell me about your
relationship, what kinds of things
did you two do together?

DEXTER
You know.         Normal father-son stuff.

FLASHBACK:

INT. MORGAN HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT
Lit only by the glow of the refrigerator,     HARRY scans its
contents for a late night snack.      He grabs a LOAF OF BREAD
and a GLASS JAR of peanut    butter.

From the shadows,      a MASKED FIGURE springs               out and pulls a TIE
around Harry's     neck.   Harry drops the jar,              which BREAKS on
the floor.    As the Intruder    pulls tighter,              Harry's face  grows
red.   He sputters       —

HARRY
Stop!       Enough!

And miraculously,           the Intruder  lets  go.       Harry rubs his neck.
The Intruder    pulls         of his mask to reveal       — TEENAGE DEXTER.

TEENAGE DEXTER
Are you         okay?
HARRY
I'm fine,    I'm     fine.
(then)
Nice ambush.       You chose        the   perfect
point    of    attack.

TEENAGE DEXTER
I can' t believe  I finally got            you.
(beat)
I won.
Harry   looks     at Dexter          sternly.
HARRY
This    isn't     a game,       Dexter.
TEENAGE DEXTER
No, I know.        I just meant —
DEXTER 108 "Shrink Wrap"        Writer's Draft - 08/08/2006    19.


(.                           HARRY
It's not supposed to be fun. I'm
trusting   you with a lot.    You have
to be      responsible.
(off   Dexter)
I know your urges are strong,      but
you can't get caught up. You have
to stay in control.       Understand?
ON TEENAGE DEXTER —      nodding, taking this      in...
PRELAP — THE BUZZ OF A SECURITY GATE.
INT. COUNTY JAIL - VISITING ROOM - DAY 3
A GUARD leadB LaGuerta in, pulling the security gate shut
behind her. Waiting at a table for LaGuerta sits a hand-
cuffed, orange-jump-suited NEIL PERRY. She joins him.
NEIL
I knew you'd miss me.
LAGUERTA
Don't flatter yourself, Neil.
[''     She throws a FILE on the table.
LAGUERTA
I want to go over your case before
trial. Comb through every detail.
The Notorious Ice Truck Killer.
PERRY
I confessed. What more do you need?
LAGUERTA
Confession'8 never a slam dunk. We
need to clarify some inconsistencies.
(opens the file)
For starter8, we haven't been able to
match your prints against the partial
we got off the lozenge wrapper we
found at the abandoned hospital.
Perry smiles. Shows her his fingers. THE TIPS ARE SCARRED.
PERRY
Liquid nitrogen. I used it to freeze
the body parts. Extremely effective,
but it burns like a bitch.
DEXTER 108   "Shrink Wrap"       Writer's Draft - 08/08/2006   20.


{                              LAGUERTA
Or, you knew your prints wouldn't
match, so you purposely burned your
fingers to hide it.
PERRY
Are you suggesting I'm a liar?
LAGUERTA
Just covering my bases, Neil.     We
both want the same thing.
PERRY
Ten minutes with Angelina?
LAGUERTA
To see you get convicted.
She's taken Perry off-guard.
PERRY

Especially when I have reading to do.
Dexter calls up a temporary E-mail account he's set up for
his Craigslist responses: FrozenBarbie@hotmail.com.   He's

Then again, it is nice to have
company...
And he opens one. It reads: "Hey, Barbie.       How'd you like to
suck my cock?" His face falls.

attractive thirty-something in a power suit, sits on
Meridian's couch, weeping.
VANESSA
I feel like I'm spinning out. Before
therapy, I had my life under control.
Meridian talks to Vanessa from off-screen —
MERIDIAN (O.S.)
Control is an illusion.
VANESSA
I felt better when I waB on the
anti-depressants. Why did you take
me off them so suddenly?
MERIDIAN (O.S.)
Because I was respecting your
wishes. You didn't want to take
them in the first place.

MERIDIAN (O.S.) (CONT'D)
/•""^                 You 8aid they were a crutch. I
'                     think you were right.
VANESSA
But now I can't get out of bed in
the morning.
(beat)
Sometimes I think about killing
myself. But I don't think I could
go through with it.
MERIDIAN (O.S.)
You've never shied away from a
challenge before.
VANESSA
I'm just so confused.
(beat)
Do you think I should just end it?
MERIDIAN (O.S.)
I can't make that decision for you.
But I do understand the appeal. No
more pain. No more responsibility...
/4$%t>\     Dexter pauses the video. Leans back in the chair.
DEXTER (V.O.)
Clever. Pulling her off anti-
depressants, making her suicidal.
After that, all she needed was a
little extra push. I wonder if this
is how he killed them all...
Dexter feels his cell phone vibrating again. He pulls it out
— another text from Rita: "Come over. I need youl" He puts
it back in his pocket, and begins dragging and dropping the
video files onto a flash drive.
DEXTER (V.O.)
This is all the proof I need.
After tomorrow night, the doctor
will be out. Permanently.
Dexter puts the flash drive in his pocket and heads off...
INT. RITA'S HOUSE - NIGHT 4
Rita, wearing a sexy nightgown, opens the door to find Dexter.
DEXTER
(/**5N>                 Hey, I got your texts. Is
everything —
DEXTER 108   "Shrink Wrap"        Writer's Draft - 08/08/2006   40,


'        And much to Dexter's surprise, she pulls him into a
passionate kiss. After a moment he pulls away —
DEXTER
— Okay?
RITA
(grinning)
It is now.
As Rita closes the door. Dexter sees the room is lit by
candles.
DEXTER
Power out again?
RITA
No...
(leading him to the couch)
I wanted to see you. I felt badly
about missing lunch to be with Paul
and the kids. I hope you didn't
get the wrong idea...

X^H,                          DEXTER
No, of course not.
(then)
How did it go?
RITA
Really good. And incredibly scary.
For the first time in a while, I felt
how easy it would be to go back to my
old life.
DEXTER
Why's that's scary?
RITA
Because. I like my new life. I
finally feel like I'm in control. I
never felt that way with Paul.
(off Dexter)
I do with you.
DEXTER
(forcing a smile)
That's great...
Rita pulls him into another kiss, crawling on top of him.
DEXTER 108   "Shrink Wrap"        Writer's Draft - 08/08/2006   41.


DEXTER (V.O.)
Thia is a disaster. I chose Rita
because she was damaged. If she
heals, I'll lose her for sure.
DEXTER
Wait... Astor and Cody...
RITA
They sleep through thunderstorms,
remember?
She starts unbuttoning his pants.
RITA
I'm ready, Dexter.
DEXTER
For what...?
And then she takes off her nightgown. Stands there naked.
Dexter realizes —
DEXTER
^t^                O h . •.

RITA
I don't know what I've been so
1
afraid of. You're the perfect
boyfriend.

(beat)
I want you to spend the night, Dexter.
For real.
•           She leans in for a kiss, but Dexter pulls away —
i

DEXTER
What happens in the morning, when
the kids find me here?
RITA
We'll figure it out...
She leans in again, and Dexter pulls away... again.
DEXTER
I'm sorry...
(off Rita)
I came over because I thought
something was wrong. But tonight's
^                  really not a good night. I'm in
the middle of a lot of work —

/*"*•.
RITA
Now?    It's late?
DEXTER
All the more reason to get back to
it. Clock's ticking. I'll call
you tomorrow, okay?
He kisses her, exits. OFF RITA, confused, watching him go —
EXT. RITA'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
As Dexter shuts the front door behind him, exiting Rita's —
DEXTER
Shit!
As he walks to his car —
DEXTER (V.O.)
I can't have sex with Rita. Every
time I sleep with a woman, she sees me
for what I really am. Empty. And
then it's over.
r^          He opens the car door, getB in. Sits. Thinks.
DEXTER (V.O.)
But I like seeing Rita. Which
means I'm going to have to deal
with this.
(shuts the car door)
I can't kill Meridian tomorrow. I
need another therapy session.
INT. HOSPITAL - PROSTHETICS LAB - DAY 5
CLOSE ON a screw, turning. Rudy's putting the final touches
on a prosthetic arm.   Debra knocks on the door frame.
Enters. Rudy smiles, picks up the arm.
RUDY
Stay where you are. I'm armed.
DEBRA
With bad puns?
(kisses him)
You said you needed a favor. What's
up?
(*****•     AB Rudy places the arm with several others —
DEXTER 108   "Shrink Wrap"      Writer's Draft - 08/08/2006     43,


RUDY
Take off your pants.
DEBRA
(laughs)
I should have known it was that
kind of favor. You never ask me to
drop by before work.
RUDY
No, but I like the way you think.
(off her smile)
I have a patient who lost both her
legs in a car accident. Really
brutal.
DEBRA
Like your mom.
RUDY
(smiles, she remembered)
Right. Which is why I want to do
something special for her. Give her a
smokin' new pair of legs.

RUDY
Just let me take a cast. Twenty

i
He brings her to an examining table next to a tray full of
plaster of Paris. Stirs it.
DEBRA
I don't know... It looks... goopey.
RUDY
C'mon. Quit being such a chick.
She smirks, sighs, shrugs, nods. Gently, he unbuttons her
pantB. She uses his shoulders to balance as he pulls them
off, one leg at a time. He gestures to the examining table.
RUDY

{                          DEBRA
It actually feels kind of good.
As he works his way up her leg —
RUDY
(smiles)
We can play with it later, if you
want. That'd be a helluva story to
tell in the bullpen, huh?
DEBRA
I haven't told anyone about us.
RUDY
Embarrassed to be banging Captain
Hook?
DEBRA
Not even a little.
Rudy stops working, looks at her. Waiting for an answer.
Clearly, he's offended.   She gathers her courage —
DEBRA
I guess it's because... this
actually matters to me. So if I
talk about it, and it goes away,
I'm actually losing something.
(beat)
Is that retarded?
RUDY
No. But I'll tell you right now —
You've got nothing to worry about.
He kneels down, so he's eye level with her.        Puts his hand on
her face.
RUDY
I'm not going anywhere.
DEBRA
Seriously?
He nods.   Debra's touched. After a moment —
RUDY
Neither are you, by the way.     I've
got your leg.
She laughs and kisses him...

INT. POLICE STATION - BULLPEN - DAY 5
Debra exits the elevator and falls into step with Doakes. As
they walk down the hallway, she's got a big smile on her face.
DOAKES
Where were you?
DEBRA
With my boyfriend.
Doakes raises an eyebrow as they head into the bullpen.
DOAKES
Boyfriend?
DEBRA
Yup. We just fucked in his office.
We're having dinner later.
The other COPS overhear — catcalling her —
DEBRA

yfi$fr\                 And he's got a monster cock.
Doakes chuckles as he heads into LaGuerta'B office —

Doakes finds LaGuerta at her desk.
DOAKES
You were looking for me?
LAGUERTA
Yes.  Shut the door.
(as he does)
Did you tell anyone about our bust?
The one that got me promoted?
DOAKES
No —
LAGUERTA
Nobody in the press?
DOAKES
Maria. We talked about this when it
happened. It'd fuck up your rep, and
f0^                      I'd look like a whiny bitch. All
kinds of bad for both of U B .

\     LaGuerta nods.    She believes him.
LAGUERTA
So then, the only way to access
that information would be to look
at the police report, right?
DOAKES
(shrugs)
I guess.
LaGuerta takeB this in.
LAGUERTA
I'm going to have to get our
firewall checked.
DOAKES
Why?
LAGUERTA
Just a hunch.
OFF LAGUERTA, wheels turning...
(***-     INT. MERIDIAN'S OFFICE - DAY 5
Dexter sits across from Meridian, mid-session.     Still shaken.
DEXTER
It was the first time Rita ever
asked me to spend the night. I
didn't know what to say.
MERIDIAN
Maybe Bhe just wanted the company.
DEXTER
(shakes his head no)
She definitely wanted the sex.
MERIDIAN
So what'd you do?
DEXTER
Made up an excuse. Got out of
there, toot sweet.
Meridian regards him. Curious.

Don't you like her?
DEXTER 108   "Shrink Wrap"      Writer's Draft - 08/08/2006   47,


DEXTER
That's just it. I do.
MERIDIAN
But you're still not ready to take
things to the next level,
(off Dexter — right)
You don't want her too close to
you. You're afraid she won't like
what she sees.
DEXTER
(amazed)
Yes. Exactly.
MERIDIAN
I feel like thiB is connected to
your control issues. By not having
(                       sex, you're exerting your power.
Dexter leans forward, interested.
DEXTER
I don't understand.
(                             MERIDIAN
There are four instances in which
human beings completely surrender

orgasm, and death. I believe that

I                       I don't know how.
(beat)
I mean, how to let go. I know how
to have sex.
Meridian nods —   now they're getting somewhere.
MERIDIAN
I'd like to try talking you through a
deep relaxation technique. It might
help bring some things to the surface.
DEXTER
(cautious)
(***                What kind of things?

'                           MERIDIAN
There has to be a time in your life
when you felt powerless. I believe
that if we can access that memory,
we might find the root of your
control issues.
(off Dexter'B hesitation)
These kinds of exerciBeB can be
very helpful if you're willing to
take a chance.
Dexter figures, it couldn't hurt...
DEXTER
Sure.   Just tell me what I need to do.
Meridian gets up. Dims the lights.
MERIDIAN
For now, just close your eyes and
focus on your breathing. Count each
breath in... one. And out... two.
(off Dexter — seriously?)
Just give it a try. And in...
one... and out... two.
Tentatively, Dexter closes his eyes.   Begins breathing.
DEXTER (V.O.)
In... one. This is ridiculous. I
could be killing him right now.
Out... two.
MERIDIAN
Now think of a time you felt
completely, utterly powerless.
DEXTER (V.O.)
In... one. I will say, it is
soothing... Out... two...
As Dexter inhales again, relaxing into it —

FLASHBACK:

Joshua finishes   up and starts to walk away, dribbling the
ball.  Dexter listens   to the rhythmic BOUNCE. BOUNCE.
BOUNCE... and readies himself to pounce.
Dexter's taken off-guard   when a FIGURE tackles him from
behind.  He falls   to the ground, struggling against a firm
police chokehold. REVEAL — Harry, pulling      tighter around
Dexter'a neck.    As Dexter fights for breath   —
HARRY
You said you walked away.   That
should have been the end of   it.
DEXTER
(coughing)
I couldn't help   it.
HARRY
And now look what happened.      You
got    caught.
(pulls   tighter)
This? Right here?       This is how it
feels   to get caught. Powerless.
-^      Dexter's now bright red, about to pass out.          As Harry   lets
C        go, Dexter collapses.   He gasps for breath,        doubled over —
HARRY
You stay in control,   Dexter.   If you
want to survive,  you need to stay in
control.  No exceptions.       Understand?
Dexter nods, still  struggling.       OFF TEENAGE DEXTER —          never
wanting to feel that way        again...

INT. RITA'S HOUSE - NIGHT 5
Rita, wearing only an over-sized T-shirt, answers the door to
find a bleary-eyed Dexter.
RITA
Hey... are you okay?
He answers with a passionate kisB.  She pulls away to look
at him, curious and confused. And then returns his kiss with
even greater passion.
SMASH CUT TO:

INT. RITA'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT 5
Rita's on top of Dexter, as they make love for the first time.
Terrified, Dexter never takes his eyes off of her. For Rita,
this makes it all the more intimate. She puts her hand on his
face, holding his gaze.
As her movements get more intense, Dexter starts to panic. He
grabs her, trying to slow her down, but she misinterprets his
forcefulness for passion. He struggles with her, his face
contorting. He looks like any other man about to come, but —
DEXTER
I can't —
RITA
(breath heavy)
It's okay... I want you to...
Dexter grabs her, rolling on top of her, trying to regain
control. Struggling, almost thrashing. But it's too late.
He thrusts hard, groans, and collapses on top of her. And in
a moment, it' s over...

PERRY
I hope you came here to apologize.
LAGUERTA
Nope.   Came for a consult.
She puts the cooler on the table.
PERRY
You brought beverages?
LAGUERTA
(ignoring him)
I got this on loan from the morgue.
I could use an expert opinion.
From the bag, she pulls out a MAN'S SEVERED HEAD. Perry
flinches.
LAGUERTA
Autopsy says this guy was dead
before his head came off. Any idea
how the killer did him?
NEIL
(panicking)
No —
LAGUERTA
Really? I figured you would. I mean,
you cut people up into pieces.
(off him)
Hang on, let me get a pad and pen.
I want to take notes.
She reaches into the knapsack and bumps the head.   It starts
to roll towards Perry. He flinches.
LAGUERTA
Shit.
She grabs the head and props it up, facing Perry. Perry's
eyes go wide. LaGuerta takes out her pen and pad. Perry's
really struggling to keep it together.
LAGUERTA
What's wrong? You've seen worse.
Perry turns away from the head, fighting his gag reflex.

LAGUERTA
You're not a murderer at all, are
you, Neil?
PERRY
I'm the Ice Truck Killer.
LAGUERTA
I talked to the medical examiner.
He couldn't confirm how your mom
died. Just that the body waB cut
up. He said she could have died of
a heart attack. And I think that's
exactly what happened.
PERRY
I killed her, that bitch.
LAGUERTA
You wanted to get your mom back for
everything she put you through.
The abuse. The name calling.
Making you feel like a failure.
But you didn't have the guts.

!                  After she died, you tried to cut her
up, but you didn't have even have the
stomach for that.
PERRY
Fuck you.
LAGUERTA
So when the Ice Truck Killer came
along, you saw a way to make a name
for yourself. Without doing all
the dirty work.
PERRY
Bullshit. I know all the details
of the case. Things that weren't
published in the newspapers.
LaGuerta eyes him. Gets up. Sits on the table, puts the
head in her lap, and looks him in the face.
LAGUERTA
I had Miami Metro's firewall
checked. Someone hacked into the
computer system. But you already

Perry'B now sweating.
PERRY
Why are you doing this?   I cleared
your case for you...
LAGUERTA
He was your hero. You wanted to
know what it would feel like. To
be him. And then you thought,
maybe you could. So you broke into
the system. Found out all the
details. And waited to get caught.

But you're no killer. You're a
coward.
Almost as punctuation, she puts the head in his lap.
Finally, Perry begins to sputter and weep.
PERRY
sr^                You're right, okay? I lied. Now

this victory —
INT. RITA'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY 6 (MORNING)
Morning light pours in through the window. Dexter sleeps
soundly next to Rita. She rolls over, draping her arm around
him. Dexter's eyes pop open at the touch. As he takes in his
surroundings, he realizes — they had Bex. He came. And he's
fucked.
Dexter nervously elides out of bed. Starts putting on his
clothes. As he sits on the end of the bed to put on his
shoes, Rita stirs. She wakes up and sees him. Smiles.
RITA
You're sweet.

MERIDIAN
Those sound like real breakthroughs,
Dexter. You should be proud.

I don't know what you're talking
about.
DEXTER
Maybe if you focus on your
breathing, you'll remember.
Dexter reaches into the BAG he's brought with him. Pulls out
a portable DVD player. Presses PLAY. ON THE SCREEN —
Vanessa Gayle sobs.
MERIDIAN (O.S.)
You've never shied away from a
challenge before.
VANESSA
I'm just so confused.
(beat)
Do you think I should just end it?

f                              MERIDIAN (O.S.)
I can't make that decision for you.
But I do understand the appeal. No
more pain. No more responsibility...
Dexter presses STOP.
MERIDIAN
Those sessions are confidential.
How did you — ?
DEXTER
Call me a control freak — I broke
into your office. Watched all the
videos. Impressive skills of
persuasion, Doctor. But a real abuse
of power, don't you think?
(off Meridian)
No wonder you're so well-versed in
control issues. You've got a textbook
God complex.
MERIDIAN
I'm calling the police.
(           As he reaches for the phone, Dexter rises.
DEXTER
Don't get me wrong, Doc. If you're
a pot, I'm kettle. We're both
black...
Dexter grabs Meridian's arm. Meridian drops the phone,
shocked by the physical contact.
DEXTER
But you really helped me realize
something. The fact that I'm a
killer? That's just something I
can't control.
Meridian tries to pull hiB arm away. But Dexter holds tight.
DEXTER
Which means even though you've been
incredibly helpful — I'm still
going to have to kill you.
Dexter lets go of his arm, smiles. Once free, Meridian
jtfffV.
immediately takes off. Runs into —
DEXTER 108   "Shrink Wrap"     Writer's Draft - 08/08/2006       58.


INT. DR. MERIDIAN'S OFFICE - WAITING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
But there's no escape. Dexter has covered it in plastic, and
his tools are waiting. As Meridian realizes that Dexter is,
in fact, a serial killer — Dexter grabs him.
DEXTER
I'm sorry, Doctor. But I have to
let you go.
Meridian's eyes go wide. Dexter shuts the office door. PUSH
IN on the hanger that reads: "IN SESSION."  HEAR the RIP of
duct tape and then — FADE TO BLACK. A beat.
FADE IN TO:
INT. DEBRA'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT 6
Debra blasts "I'm So Excited" on her stereo as she bops
around her bedroom in a pair of jeans and a bra. As she
chooses clothes from her closet, she sings along —
DEBRA
I'm so excited. And I just can't
hide it. I'm about to lose control
and I think I like it...
Her phone RINGS.    She answers.
DEBRA
Hello?
INTERCUT WITH:
INT. RUDY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 6
CLOSE ON RUDY.
RUDY
Is that The Pointer Sisters?
DEBRA
(turns down the volume)
No. What's up?
RUDY
I'm running a little late. I'm in
the middle of some housework, and
if it's not done before I see you,
yflflffi^y
it'll drive me crazy all night.
DEBRA
I never knew you were so anal.
DEXTER 108   "Shrink Wrap"     Writer's Draft - 08/08/2006       59,

J^3^,


RUDY
And I'm a neat-freak.
DEBRA
(laughing)
You're full of surprises, huh?
RUDY
You have no idea.
(beat)
I'll be there as soon as I can.
As Debra hangs up the phone, happy —
PULL BACK TO REVEAL Rudy's housework: He drags LARGE PLASTIC
TUBS OF BLOOD to an over-sized refrigerator — humming "I'm
So Excited" as he works. He passes:
— A BULLETIN BOARD: PHOTOS of dead hookers, Toni Tucci, and
their respective crime scenes.
— AN OVERSIZED CHAIR populated with BARBIE DOLLS
— A CART FULL OF SURGICAL PARAPHERNALIA
I
A veritable scrapbook of our series so far. Rudv is the ice
Truck Killer! And then we realize, oh shit — is Debra next?
Still humming, Rudy sits down at a computer, The Miami
CraigsliBt Missed Connections are pulled up on the screen.
On his screen: "Dear Ken, I'm in pieces. Why the cold
shoulder? Love, Barbie." Rudy smiles. Hits respond. And
types: "Barbie - Be patient. One day we'll share a cold
one." He hits send, and grins —
SMASH TO BLACK.
